# Experiment Assignment 2 #
I went through the Derby installation process and got it working in my terminal (sysinfo spews out the correct things, and I could use the database, etc...).
I then went on to Experiment 1, and couldn't get any further from there.
I tried both importing the maven project and creating my own by following the vogella tutorial, but I couldn't run the Main.java file mentioned in 4.3 on the vogella tutorial. 
The error message I received was:
Configuration Error. Class [org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver] not found.

I assume it's an issue with my environment variables, but I haven't managed to solve it yet. Spent several hours trying to solve this problem without any luck.

## Pending issues: ##
* Solve "Configuration Error. Class [org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver] not found."
* Complete Experiment 1
* Complete Experiment 2

### The Configuration Error I got: ###
