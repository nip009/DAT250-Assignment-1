# Laboratory report #
Maven couldn't be found when I tried to use the command 'mvn clean install', so I had to download and install Maven, and add JDK path to JAVA_HOME in environment variables to solve the problem.

When trying to push local changes I also got some errors:
* The symbol 'science' couldn't be resolved in hello.html. I had to restart my IDE, Eclipse in order for it to work.

* 'mvn clean install' resulted in an error. In order to solve it I had to close everything, both my cmd and Eclipse, so that the server wasn't running. Running 'mvn clean install' then worked.


The software development environment was working, since the code compiled and ran. I also changed the code, and added new files during the Heroku guide.

I didn't add the add-ons that was mentioned in the Heroku guide, because it required my credit card information.
