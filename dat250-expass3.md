I also looked at the bulk write operations tutorial.

## Experiment 2 ##
I read the tutorials and created an additional operation. 
I created an operation that can help the stores that are selling their products. 
This operation makes it easier for them to see how many of each product that they have sold, how many different people have bought them,
the price of each item, and how much money each item has totalled when taking all the sales into account.

The output is as follows:

Here we can see that 4 different people have bought apples, and that they have in total bought 35 of them. 
The price of each apple is 2.5 and the total cost of all the apples sold is 87.5. We have the same overview of all the items that have been sold.
